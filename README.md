| Prop          | Description                            | Type         | Default     | Required? |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------- |
| `suggestions` | Data source for suggestions            | Suggestion[] | n/a         | Y         |
| `className`   | Optional class name to style component | string       | ''          | N         |
| `name`        | Input name                             | string       | 'q'         | N         |

| `autoFocus`   | Input autoFocus                        | boolean      | `false`     | N         |
| `onChange`    | Input onChange handler                 | function     | `undefined` | N         |

##Â Styling

As mentioned above, you can provide a `className` to the component. It comes with some very basic styling.

See [index.html](./index.html) from an example.

**Important**: The `:focus` attribute is what powers the active state of a selected element. This is what you want to target to style highlighted search results.

## Arrow Key Navigation

You get this functionality for free and was the main motivation for creating this shared component.
